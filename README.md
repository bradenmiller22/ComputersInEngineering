## 🧠 Project Summaries

### 🚀 Asteroids

**Description**: A simulation of the classic Asteroids game.

**Features**:
- Object-oriented design with classes representing ships, asteroids, and bullets
- Real-time user input handling for navigation and shooting
- Collision detection between objects
- Score tracking and game-over conditions

**Technologies**: C++, possibly utilizing graphics libraries (e.g., SFML or SDL)

### 🏎️ RaceCar

**Description**: A race car simulation project.

**Features**:
- Simulation of race car dynamics
- User-controlled acceleration, braking, and steering
- Lap timing and performance metrics

**Technologies**: C++, with potential use of physics engines or custom physics calculations
